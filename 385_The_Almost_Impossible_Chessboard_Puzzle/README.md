Today's challenge is to implement the solution to a well-known math puzzle involving
prisoners and a chessboard. I won't state the puzzle or give the solution here, but
you can find many writeups online:

# Challenge
First, assume that there exists a function flip that takes a series of 64 bits (0 or 1)
and a number from 0 to 63. This function returns the same series of bits with the
corresponding bit flipped. e.g.:

```
flip([0, 0, 0, 0, ...], 2) => [0, 0, 1, 0, ...]
flip([0, 1, 0, 1, ...], 1) => [0, 0, 0, 1, ...]
```

Now, you need to write two functions.

Function `prisoner1` takes two inputs: a series `S` of 64 bits, and a number `X` from
0 to 63 (inclusive). It returns a number `Y` from 0 to 63.

Function `prisoner2` takes one input: a series `T` of 64 bits.
It returns a number from 0 to 63.

Now, you must make it so that if you flip `S` using the output of prisoner1 and pass
the result to prisoner2, you get back the number `X`. Put another way, the following
function must return True for every possible valid input `S` and `X`.

```
def solve(S, X):
    Y = prisoner1(S, X)
    T = flip(S, Y)
    return prisoner2(T) == X
```

Essentially, `prisoner1` is encoding the value `X` into the sequence with a single flip,
and `prisoner2` is decoding it. In the puzzle statement, `X` is the location of the key,
`Y` is the coin that gets flipped, `S` is the starting state of the board, and `T` is
the state after the flip occurs.
